    <h1>1986</h1>
    <h4 class="history-text">At the 1986 annual conference of the Ministers of Transport for France, Germany, Belgium
      and The Netherlands, a
      high-speed network between Paris – Brussels - Cologne/Amsterdam, or PBKAL for short (the first letters of each
      connected
      city) was discussed for the first time. The L referred to London, which would also be connected to this network
      via the
      Channel Tunnel.</h4>

          <p class="events-text">Opened in 1994, the Eurotunnel is an engineering marvel, connecting the UK and France
            with the world's longest undersea
            tunnel portion. It dramatically reduces travel time between the two countries, symbolizing a triumph of
            technology and

          <p class="events-text">In 2002, a significant milestone in the development of Belgium's high-speed rail
            network was marked with the opening of
            the High-Speed Line (HSL) between Leuven and Liège. This line was a key part of Belgium's commitment to
            enhancing its
            railway infrastructure, greatly reducing travel time between these two major cities.<br><br>The
            Leuven-Liège
            HSL was a testament to Belgium's dedication to modernizing its transportation system, providing faster,
            more efficient connections that catered to both the country's growing commuter base and its position in
            the
            broader
            European high-speed train network.</p>

        <div class="event-content">
          <div class="hsl-4-animation"></div>
          <p class="events-text">2009 witnessed the further expansion of Belgium's high-speed rail capabilities with
            two
            significant openings. The first
            was the Chênée - Walhorn section, which included the impressive Soumagne Tunnel, known for being the
            longest
            railway
            tunnel in Belgium. This section was crucial for enhancing the connectivity in the eastern part of the
            country.
            <br><br>The same year, the high-speed line between Antwerp and the Dutch border began operations,
            effectively linking major
            Belgian cities with the Netherlands. This extension not only facilitated smoother cross-border travel but
            also
            solidified Belgium's role in the expanding network of European high-speed rail.
