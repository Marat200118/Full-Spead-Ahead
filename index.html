    <h1>1986</h1>
    <h4 class="history-text">At the 1986 annual conference of the Ministers of Transport for France, Germany, Belgium
      and The Netherlands, a
      high-speed network between Paris – Brussels - Cologne/Amsterdam, or PBKAL for short (the first letters of each
      connected
      city) was discussed for the first time. The L referred to London, which would also be connected to this network
      via the
      Channel Tunnel.</h4>

          <h3>Environmental<br> Concerns</h3>
          <p class="opinion-text">The French were in favour of a high-speed network with a maximum speed of 300 km/h.
            The
            Germans
            wanted to go even faster, at 350 km/h. The Belgians and the Dutch were more cautious and wanted to start
            with a
            maximum speed of 250 km/h.</p>

        <div class="opinion-block">
          <h3>Regional Development Concerns</h3>
          <p class="opinion-text">In Belgium, there was specific resistance in the Campine region against the HST. This resistance was partly due to
          concerns about the impact on the local environment and communities</p>

        <div class="opinion-block">
          <h3>Financial<br> Costs</h3>
          <p class="opinion-text">Critics pointed out the high costs associated with building and maintaining high-speed rail lines. The investment
          required for such projects is substantial, leading to concerns about whether the financial benefits justify the expense.</p>

          <h3>Economic <br>Development</h3>
          <p class="opinion-text">Proponents argued that high-speed trains could significantly boost economic development. They improve connectivity
          between cities, reduce travel times, and can attract businesses and tourism.</p>

        <div class="opinion-block">
          <h3>Job <br>Creation</h3>
          <p class="opinion-text">The construction and operation of HST lines were also seen as opportunities for job creation, both directly in the
          railway sector and indirectly in related industries.</p>

          <h3>Modernization of <br>Transport</h3>

          leading European nations that were already investing in high-speed rail.</p>

          <p class="events-text">Opened in 1994, the Eurotunnel is an engineering marvel, connecting the UK and France with the world's longest undersea
          tunnel portion. It dramatically reduces travel time between the two countries, symbolizing a triumph of technology and
          international cooperation.</p>
